Experiment: In vivo calcium imaging of dorsal root ganglia neurons, applying mechanical (50, 100, 150g of force) and thermal stimulation(10oC and 50oC for 30sec each). When a neuron responds to the stimulation the fluorescence (intracel-
lular calcium increases). Upon the death of the animal at the end of the experiment, all neurons became fluorescent. The timelapse wa aligned and all cells (ROIs) were circled. 


background (mean grey value of a background area - rows are frames)

rawdata (mean grey value of all ROIs - columns are #cell and rows are frames)

events (frames - first row is the name of stimulation, second row is the frame that the stimulation began and the third row is the frame that the stimulation ended)

timing (seconds between frames)

size (area of the ROIs)


QUESTIONS: - Subtract the background signal from the rawdata of each ROI, to normalise data
           - Calculate the amplitude of the neuronal response: ΔF/F0 = (Ft-F0)/F0
              Ft=fluorescence recorded for each ROI at each timepoint
              F0=baseline fluorescence signal averaged over the baseline period corresponding to the lowest fluorescence signal over the recording period
           - Responding neurons to stimulation: ΔF/F0 is beyond the threshold of 3 times standard deviation of baseline
